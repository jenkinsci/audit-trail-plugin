This plugin keeps a log of who performed particular Jenkins operations, such as configuring jobs.

This plugin adds an _Audit Trail_ section in the main Jenkins configuration page.
On this page, you can configure log destination and settings
(eg file size and number of rotating log files), and a URI pattern for
requests to be logged.
The default options select most actions with
significant effect such as creating/configuring/deleting jobs and views
or delete/save-forever/start a build.
The log is sent to the target as configured (writen to disk, to console, sent to Elastic Search or Syslog).

Also see the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JobConfigHistory+Plugin[JobConfigHistory
Plugin] for recording actual changes made to job configurations.

== Logger Configuration

=== File logger

Output audit logs in rolling files.

The file logger relies on `java.util.logging.FileHandler` and can use
patterns to describe the log file location as documented
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/FileHandler.html[here]
(`+%h+`, `+%g+`...).

A separator can be set for the file logger in case further parsing of the file is done.
Default separator is a space.

=== Syslog logger

Send audit logs to a Syslog server.

== Other configuration

=== Log build triggers

Will log the cause of a build. Defaults to true.

=== Log credential users

Will log usage of credentials as long as they are consumed through the https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/[Credentials plugin].
Defaults to true.

=== Log Groovy script usage

Will log potentially dangerous groovy scripts, for example from the script console. Defaults to true.

=== About the client IP-address appearing in the logs
====
The plugin uses a method that cannot guarantee that the actual IP of the client is captured.
https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getRemoteAddr--[More details]
Be aware of this limitation, especially if your instance is configured behind a reverse proxy.
For getting client IP-address correctly it's required to set HTTP-header *X-Forwarded-For* on the reverse proxy side.
Also follow these https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-troubleshooting/[recommendations] in order to get round this limitation.
