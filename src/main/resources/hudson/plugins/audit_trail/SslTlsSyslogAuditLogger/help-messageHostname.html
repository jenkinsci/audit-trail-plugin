    HOSTNAME field of the Syslog message as defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424">RFC 5424 - The
    Syslog Protocol</a>.

    <blockquote cite="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.4">
        The HOSTNAME field identifies the machine that originally sent the
        syslog message.<br/>
        <br/>
        The HOSTNAME field SHOULD contain the hostname and the domain name of
        the originator in the format specified in STD 13 [RFC1034]. This
        format is called a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in this
        document.<br/>
        <br/>
        In practice, not all syslog applications are able to provide an FQDN.
        As such, other values MAY also be present in HOSTNAME. This document
        makes provisions for using other values in such situations. A syslog
        application SHOULD provide the most specific available value first.
        The order of preference for the contents of the HOSTNAME field is as
        follows:<br/>
        <br/>
        1. FQDN<br/>
        <br/>
        2. Static IP address<br/>
        <br/>
        3. hostname<br/>
        <br/>
        4. Dynamic IP address<br/>
        <br/>
        5. the NILVALUE<br/>
        <br/>
        If an IPv4 address is used, it MUST be in the format of the dotted
        decimal notation as used in STD 13 [RFC1035]. If an IPv6 address is
        used, a valid textual representation as described in [RFC4291],
        Section 2.2, MUST be used.<br/>
        <br/>
        Syslog applications SHOULD consistently use the same value in the
        HOSTNAME field for as long as possible.<br/>
        <br/>
        The NILVALUE SHOULD only be used when the syslog application has no
        way to obtain its real hostname. This situation is considered highly
        unlikely.
